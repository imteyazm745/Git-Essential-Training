Mac/Linux Setup
Installing Git
Git is actually installed on MacOS, but we'll be reinstalling it so that we'll have the newest version:
go to https://git-scm.com/downloads
download the software for Mac
install Git choosing all of the default options
Once everything is installed, you should be able to run git on the command line. If it displays the usage information, then you're good to go!

First Time Git Configuration : Before you can start using Git, you need to configure it. Run each of the following lines on the command line to make sure everything is set up.
    # sets up Git with your name
    git config --global user.name "<Your-Full-Name>"

    # sets up Git with your email
    git config --global user.email "<your-email-address>"

    # makes sure that Git output is colored
    git config --global color.ui auto

    # displays the original state in a conflict
    git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3

    # displays the details
    git config --list
