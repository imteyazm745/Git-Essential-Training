Mac/Linux Setup
Installing Git
Git is actually installed on MacOS, but we'll be reinstalling it so that we'll have the newest version:
go to https://git-scm.com/downloads
download the software for Mac
install Git choosing all of the default options
Once everything is installed, you should be able to run git on the command line. If it displays the usage information, then you're good to go!
